## Exercise 1.35

Golden ratio is
x^2 = x + 1
If you divide both sides by x, it becomes
x maps to: 1 + 1/x

```scheme
#lang scheme

(define tolerance 0.00001)

(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (< (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))

(define (golden-ratio x)
  (+ 1 (/ 1 x)))

(fixed-point golden-ratio 0.5)
```

This gives 1.618035190615836 which is the same as that in page 38 up to 4 decimal places
