## Exercise 1.4

> Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expression. Use this observation to describe the behaviour of the following procedures:
```scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
    (if (> b 0) + -) a b)
```

if our argument b for the procedure a-plus-abs-b is bigger than 0, we will add a and b

> $f(x) = a + b$

If our argument b for procedure a-plus-abs-b is less than 0, we will minus a and b

> $f(x) = a - b$ where b is negative

Effectively, this means that a always adds to the absolute value of b
> $f(x) = a + \lvert b \rvert$
