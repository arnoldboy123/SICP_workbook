## Exercise 1.3

> Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers

```scheme
#lang scheme
(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (sum-of-two-square x y) (+ (square x) (square y)))

(define (sum-of-largest-two-square x y z)
        (define minimum (min x y z))
        (cond ((= minimum x) (sum-of-two-square y z))
              ((= minimum y) (sum-of-two-square x z))
              ((= minimum z) (sum-of-two-square x y))))
```
